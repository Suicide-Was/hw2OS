This program simulates a basic lottery scheduling algorithm, a form of random scheduling where processes are assigned lottery tickets, and the scheduler randomly selects a ticket to determine the next process to run. This README is an overview of the program, and a light description of the code structure.

This code has two classes which are composed of Process and Scheduler.
Processes are sent to the scheduler with a specific amount of lottery tickets.
The scheduler allocates the tickets for it to process and then selects a winning ticket randomly to see which process it will run next
The winning ID is displayed for the output as requested.
